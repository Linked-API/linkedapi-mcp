Linked API MCP server connects your LinkedIn account to AI assistants like Claude, Cursor, and VS Code. Ask them to search for leads, send messages, analyze profiles, and much more – they'll handle it through our cloud browser, safely and automatically.

## Use cases
- **Sales automation assistant**. Ask your AI to find leads, check their profiles, and draft personalized outreach. It can search for "software engineers at companies with 50-200 employees in San Francisco", analyze their backgrounds, and suggest connection messages that actually make sense.
- **Recruitment assistant**. Let your assistant search for candidates with specific skills, review their experience, and send initial outreach. It handles the time-consuming parts while you focus on actually talking to people.
- **Conversation assistant**. Your AI can read your existing LinkedIn conversations and help you respond naturally. It understands the context of your chats, suggests relevant replies, and can even send follow-up messages.
- **Market research assistant**. Need competitor analysis? Your assistant can gather data about companies, their employees, and recent activities. Get insights about industry trends without spending hours on LinkedIn.
