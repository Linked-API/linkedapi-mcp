# Linked API MCP Server

Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for [Linked API](https://linkedapi.io).

## Installation

### Get API Tokens

1. Sign up at [Linked API](https://app.linkedapi.io?ref=linkedapi-mcp)
2. Get your **LINKED_API_TOKEN** and **IDENTIFICATION_TOKEN** from the dashboard

### Workflow Behavior

Linked API workflows can take over 5 minutes to complete, which might cause the MCP client to disconnect before the results are ready. To address this, each tool invocation includes a `HEALTH_CHECK_PERIOD`â€” timeout setting in seconds, defaulting to 60 seconds. Once this period elapses, the MCP server will provide a response instructions for workflow restoration.

You can find recommended `HEALTH_CHECK_PERIOD` values for different MCP clients in examples below.
